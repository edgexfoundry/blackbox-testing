# EdgeX Foundry Blackbox Tests

This repository contains a series of tests to verify that all EdgeX services are working as expected. There are two testing frameworks used by these tests.

## Newman
Newman is a command line tool that is set up to test EdgeX as it is currently deployed to Nexus. This is useful for verifying the current state of the application.

## Postman
Postman is a GUI based tool that is set up to test arbitrary EdgeX environments and is the easiest method to set up to verify your local EdgeX deployment.

## Getting Started
Please refer to the [documentation in the repository](docs/How-to-run-blackbox-testing.rst).
